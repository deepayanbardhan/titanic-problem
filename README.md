This code is for the Kaggle contest given in the link below:

In this problem, given a training set containing information about people on the titanic and if they eventually survived or not, I have to predict the same for the test samples. As it sounds it is a simple classification problem but as it can be seen while working out that the data provided is not the perfect data and there are missing entries along or with too many features. All these has been analyzed using basic techniques.

Once the dataset is cleaned and the missing values are filled, then I proceed to the classifying the model. Various popular classifiers are used to predict the outcome. The model that gave the best result was used as the final model to predict the final results.
